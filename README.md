# Modulo-Sum
Given a sequence of positive integers a1, a2, … an, and a positive integer M. Your goal is to determine if a non-empty subsequence of a1, a2, … an that the sum of numbers in this subsequence is divisible by m.




The provided code implements a dynamic programming (DP)algorithm to solve a problem related to finding a subset of integers whose sum is divisible by a given number 'M'
